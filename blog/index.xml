Seurat, a popular R library, has emerged as a versatile toolkit for the comprehensive analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data.
While the core engine of Texera is built using Scala, it supports the integration of Python UDFs, allowing users to incorporate custom Python code directly into their data processing pipelines.</description></item><item><title>Improving Texera Operators to Simplify a Workflow from Alteryx</title><link>/blog/improving-texera-operators-to-simplify-a-workflow-from-alteryx/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jun 2023 17:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>/blog/improving-texera-operators-to-simplify-a-workflow-from-alteryx/</guid><description>(This work was done by the author at Department of Computer Science, UC Irvine.) # In this blog, we discuss how we extended Texera’s usability by providing more native support for certain advanced data analysis operations and demonstrate their benefits in a workflow migrated from Alteryx.
Texera offers a workflow operator called “Python UDF,” which enables users to specify any desired operator behavior that best suits their needs. It is a powerful tool that offers users high levels of control over their workflows.</description></item><item><title>How We Built a Real-time Collaborative Workflow Editor in Texera</title><link>/blog/how-we-built-a-real-time-collaborative-workflow-editor-in-texera/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Nov 2022 14:27:42 +0100</pubDate><guid>/blog/how-we-built-a-real-time-collaborative-workflow-editor-in-texera/</guid><description>(This work was done by the authors at Department of Computer Science, UC Irvine.) # Real-time collaborative editing has been so popularized in recent years to the point that it has become almost a hidden standard for major document editing providers. Google Docs Editors, which includes Google Docs, Google Slides, etc., was a pioneer in real-time collaborative editing. Microsoft Office did not have real-time co-authoring capability until 2013, 7 years after the initial release of Google Docs Editors.</description></item><item><title>Showing Changes Between Two Workflow Versions</title><link>/blog/showing-changes-between-two-workflow-versions/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Sep 2022 15:16:36 -0700</pubDate><guid>/blog/showing-changes-between-two-workflow-versions/</guid><description>(This work was done by the author at Department of Computer Science, UC Irvine.) # Texera has a version control system that automatically saves workflow versions so that users can easily view or restore early versions. The current implementation only shows each historical workflow. Users may find it hard to see how it differs from another workflow version, especially when there is only a tiny change. We want to improve the usability of the version control system by visually displaying the difference between two workflow versions.</description></item><item><title>Data Crawling Using Texera with Python User-Defined Functions</title><link>/blog/data-crawling-using-texera-with-python-user-defined-functions/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Aug 2022 09:19:42 +0100</pubDate><guid>/blog/data-crawling-using-texera-with-python-user-defined-functions/</guid><description>(This work was done by the author at Department of Computer Science, UC Irvine.) # Crawling is a common yet important task to collect data from the Web. However, developing a good crawling pipeline is notoriously challenging due to the following reasons:
The content and format of the Web pages can be quite unpredictable. Many &amp;ldquo;edge cases&amp;rdquo; need to be covered by the crawler and the parser. Moreover, these edge cases can happen after the pipeline has been running for a long time.</description></item></channel></rss>
